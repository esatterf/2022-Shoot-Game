# Final Project: Shoot Game
by Evan Satterfield

## Overview
Welcome to shoot game! You are a circle that shoots other circles with circles.
But watch out! Those other circles and shoot your circle with their circles.

Fittingly the most effective way to dodge is to move circularly around the enemy
circles. 

It's a fun game you'll get a*round* to it
## How to Play
WASD to move

Left click to fire

Press Space to Cycle weapons between the standard the rapid fire and the mega blast.

You start with 100 health. You take 10 damage when you get hit but regen 5 health
at the start of each level

There are 10 levels in the game with each level having 1 additional enemy

## Concepts used
Obviously this uses graphics from Module 4. It also uses inheritance from Module 2
The player, the enemies, and the bullets shot are all child classes from one main Actor
class that only knows how to move and know if it's bumped into something

## OS used
I programmed and ran this all on Ubuntu linux

## Installations needed
Just the basic ones needed to run any Module 4 project

## Grade
This program satisfies the assignment requirements.

It has no known bugs and all .h files are documented
with additional documentation  in the .cpp when needed

The controls are laid out nicely in the readme and are
intuitive in general.

This program is fun

I might have been able to go further with the polymorphism
but the program is decently complex as is.

**I think that I meet all of the requirements in the rubric**
I think I should get something close-ish to the full 140 points
